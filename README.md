[![Licence GPL](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL-green.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.fr.html)

We all at some point ended up on a webpage that we don't want to appear on our browsing history. Either it's for a gift, or a dumb page...

With "Forget That Page", you can totally delete the current webpage from your browsing history, just in one click !
It also deletes cookies, session storage, local storage and download history for that page.

It's simple but useful, and also open source !
